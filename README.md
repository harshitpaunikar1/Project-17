## Power user curve
It’s a histogram that tracks user engagement by the number of days they actively engage in a given month. It gives you a better look at your customer engagement than app stickiness: you can analyze day-by-day statistics, customer variability (i.e. who’s a power user and who’s not), short- and long-term trends, and variations among different user actions.
